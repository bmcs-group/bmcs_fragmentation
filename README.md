# Probabilistic Multiple-Cracking Model of Brittle-Matrix Composites: One-by-One Crack Tracing Algorithm

The repository contains a jupyter notebook explaining and demonstrating 
the implementation of the algorithm simulating multiple-cracking 
of a brittle-matrix composites.

## Execute with using Binder
The notebook can be executed directly
using the binder service. It takes a while for the repository image to build up.
