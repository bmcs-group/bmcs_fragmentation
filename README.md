# bmcs_fragmentation

## Focus
The repository contains a jupyter notebook explaining and demonstrating 
the implementation of the algorithm simulating multiple-cracking 
of a brittle-matrix composites.

## Prerequisites 
To execute the notebooks locally install the anaconda suite. Required packages
are specified in the environment.yml file. The entry point to the jupyter suite 
is the fragmentation.ipynb notebook.

## Binder
The notebook can be open also in the clouds without any local installation
using the binder service. It takes a while for the repository image to build up.
