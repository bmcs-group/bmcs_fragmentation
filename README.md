# Probabilistic Multiple-Cracking Model of Brittle-Matrix Composites: One-by-One Crack Tracing Algorithm

The repository contains a jupyter notebook explaining and demonstrating 
the implementation of the algorithm simulating multiple-cracking 
of a brittle-matrix composites. The repository can cited using 
the [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/265839531.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/265839531)

## Execute [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bmcs-group/bmcs_fragmentation.git/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2Ffragmentation.ipynb)
The notebook can be executed directly
using the binder service. It takes a while for the repository image to build up.

## Prerequisites 
To execute the notebooks locally install the anaconda suite. Required packages
are specified in the environment.yml file. The entry point to the jupyter suite 
is the fragmentation.ipynb notebook.
